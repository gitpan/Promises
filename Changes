Revision history for Perl extension Promises

0.02 Saturday, Nov. 24th, 2012
    - add several predicate methods to help when
      interrogating status, this resolves RT #81278.
        - thanks to Toby Inkster for this
    - fixed error chaining so that the result of an
      error in one step of the chain will be passed
      onto the next step as well, this resolves
      RT #81358.
        - thanks to TOSHIOITO for this
    - made error callbacks optional and ensured that
      the errors will bubble to the next promise in
      the chain, this resolves RT #81356.
        - thanks again to TOSHIOITO for this
